# GitHub Actions Course

DevOps has become essential for organizations aiming to automate and modernize their workflows. With its powerful capabilities, creating a pipeline to build almost any kind of application and deploy to almost any environment has never been easier. All of this can be achieved with just a click of a button.

Furthermore, DevOps features enable securing pipelines, managing secrets, and connecting to target production environments, giving rise to what is known today as DevSecOps.

Many well-known tools are available to implement DevOps, including Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps Pipelines, and many more. GitHub Actions is one such tool that has gained popularity since its launch in 2018. This success stems from GitHub's reputation as a leading platform for hosting source code used by over 50 million users. Naturally, it made sense to use the same platform to build and deploy code into production.

This course will guide you through creating CI/CD DevOps pipelines to take your code, build it, scan it, test it, and then deploy it into Dev, Test, and Prod environments, whether on-premise or in the cloud.

Through multiple demonstrations, we will showcase the powerful features of GitHub Actions.
